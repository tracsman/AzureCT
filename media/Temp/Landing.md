# Microsoft Azure Network Architecture Patterns

This page contains many diagrams of successful network architectures. Each diagram is also click-able to see more detailed information on each design.

The Page is divided into four sections:

1. [Inbound Flows](#inbound-flows)
2. [Outbound Flows](#outbound-flows)
3. [Bi-Directional Flows](#bi-directional-flows)
4. [Forced Tunneling Flows](#forced-tunneling-flows)

## Inbound Flows
These patterns are focused on traffic inbound from the internet to resources in Azure.

### First Example
![0]

Blah blah blah blah

### Second Example
![0]

Blah blah blah blah

### Third Example
![0]

Blah blah blah blah

## Outbound Flows
These patterns are focused on traffic outbound from Azure heading towards either the internet, an on-premise network, or another Azure VNet (Site-to-Site connected).

### First Example
![0]

Blah blah blah blah

### Second Example
![0]

Blah blah blah blah

### Third Example
![0]

Blah blah blah blah

## Bi-directional Flows
These patterns are focused on traffic both inbound and outbound between different networks.

### First Example
![0]

Blah blah blah blah

### Second Example
![0]

Blah blah blah blah

### Third Example
![0]

Blah blah blah blah

## Forced Tunneling Flows
These patterns are focused on traffic forced back to ExpressRoute, with no direct Internet connection to Azure.

### First Example
![0]

Blah blah blah blah

### Second Example
![0]

Blah blah blah blah

### Third Example
![0]

Blah blah blah blah
